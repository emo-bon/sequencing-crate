# sequencing-data
This repo contains information about the sequencing batches. The most important information is in the [shipment](https://github.com/emo-bon/sequencing-data/tree/main/shipment) folder:
* One subfolder for each "batch" that is sent to be sequenced

In each subfolder are spreadsheets containing 
* The ena accession numbers (from over-project to run) for that batch, linked to their material sample IDs
* Run information related to the processing of those material samples (omics metadata)

Batches that have not yet been completed will have incomplete contents.
